HIGH: Download IBM Cloud CLI on laptop. Check: https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/personality-insights-nodejs?tab=readme-ov-file

HIGH: Figure out conditional rendering of components.

HIGH: Figure out how JS async and FB API work. It seems as if FB JS API isn't loading on page load? Or am I confused?

MEDIUM: Finish the bottom of the web page and actually include links/contact info.

LOW: Figure out a way to get HTTPS working on localhost without causing issues with certificates being self-signed... learn how Blazor
     uses certificates so I can use a certificate signed via mkcert?
