  <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT ME</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Aspiring software engineer/developer with an academic concentration in NLP.</em></p>
  <p>Welcome to my website! My name's Arthur Kim and I graduated from UCLA in March of 2024 with a B.A. in Linguistics and Computer Science. My academic experience consists primarily of backend development with a particular focus on NLP, and I'm looking to work as an
    entry level software engineer/developer. I feel most comfortable programming in Python, C, and Haskell, but I have experience in C++ and shell scripting. This website and webapp serves not only as a portal to my Github and my LinkedIn but also as a live project 
    in and of itself.</p>

      <!-- added custom-resize class to the <p> tag. -->

      <p>My goal with this project is to demonstrate a variety of competencies. The underlying web framework for both the website and its integrated webapp is Blazor. I took this opportunity not only to demonstrate my adaptability by learning C# myself and piecing 
        together a front-end interface, but also to challenge myself to use a back-end language whose paradigms and design choices occupy a middle ground between C/C++ and Python that I'm not always comfortable with. Although I wrote very little HTML of my own for
        this project, I gained a lot of valuable experience understanding the underlying syntax, semantics, and structure of HTML, CSS, and website design.</p>
      <p>As of now, I'm in the process of setting up the website itself, but my goal is to learn how to implement OAuth for Facebook (and eventually other social media platforms). I'd like to use Facebook's SDK to scrape user posts and pass them to a backend that's 
        powered by IBM Watson's Personality Insights service. Based on sentiment analysis, I want to make a "genie" that'll provide whimsical suggestions based on predictions made for mood, hobbies, etc.</p>
